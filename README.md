## Installation

To get **studybuddy** up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/studybuddy.git
    cd studybuddy
    ```
    *Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username/organization and `studybuddy` with the repository name.*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    As this is a new project, a `requirements.txt` file might not be present yet. You will need to install Django and any other necessary libraries.

    Create a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project (e.g., `studybuddy/requirements.txt`) with at least the following content:

    ```
    Django~=4.0
    # Add any other libraries as your project grows, e.g.,
    # djangorestframework
    # python-dotenv
    ```

    Then install:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This command sets up the necessary database tables for the Django project.

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (optional, but recommended for administration):**
    This allows you to access the Django admin panel.

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your username, email, and password.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start the development server and access **studybuddy** through your web browser.

1.  **Start the Django development server:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active.

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

3.  **Explore the admin panel (if you created a superuser):**
    You can access the Django administration interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the superuser credentials you created.

## Configuration

Core project configuration is handled within `studybuddy/settings.py`. Here you can adjust:

*   **Database Settings**: Modify the `DATABASES` dictionary to connect to different database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   **Static Files**: Configure `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` for serving static assets in production.
*   **Security Keys**: Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is kept confidential, especially in production environments. It is highly recommended to store sensitive information like `SECRET_KEY` in environment variables or a `.env` file rather than directly in `settings.py`.

## API Documentation

Currently, **studybuddy** does not expose a public API for external integration. All interactions are handled directly through the web interface. Future versions may include API endpoints for extended functionality.
